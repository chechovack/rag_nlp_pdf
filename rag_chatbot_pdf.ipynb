We observed five mega-round deals, and a total of USD1.38 billion invested across 77 deals. The mega funding accounted for 55.5% of all funding. Despite a reduction in deal count volume, transactional volume rose quarter on quarter for the first three quarters of a year for the first time since 2020.  Overall, the Q4 funding totals represented a sharp turn of events. 5Introduction Global InsurTech funding halved quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), Broadly, 2024 can be seen as a year of two halves  a fairly from USD1.38 billion in Q3 2024 to USD688.24 million in Q4241. predictable yet encouraging H1, followed by a more volatile H2 The number of InsurTech deals increased by 1 QoQ from 77 to with an initial surge in mega-round activity followed by a sharp 78 in Q4 2024. decrease in funding in Q4. Interest in AI companies remained strong, with AI-focused We began 2024 with the observation that 2023 had been the InsurTechs accounting for 42.3% of Q4 2024 deals. With the topic year that AI was first widely taken seriously in our industry. of this quarters InsurTech report in mind, half of Q424 InsurTech This year has continued the trajectory of acceptance, with pilots, deals went to InsurTechs with a focus on claims. Q4 2024 also saw proofs of concept, use cases, technological development and 45 venture technology investments from (re)insurance companies. most importantly, a further bedding-in of AI being used in real life scenarios. We observed that, on average, AI-enabled InsurTechs Looking at year-on-year (YoY) comparisons between 2024 and raised an additional $5 million when compared with their non-AI 2023; total global InsurTech funding dropped 5.6% YoY, from cousins.

Global InsurTech deal count fell 18.5% YoY, from 422 in 2023 to 344 in 2024  the lowest since 2019. Early- It is also true that AI is a buzzword. Like many other labels before stage funding and average deal sizes increased YoY  8.8% and it, it is in vogue as a marketing term (and even as a top-level 14.6%, respectively.

From a geographical standpoint, there is a lack of clarity and discipline around how the term is the UK cemented its position as the worlds second-most used. It is easy to dismiss some of this as hype, or to point out significant market for InsurTech in 2024. 9.3% of deals involved a that not all the value technology providers have promised over UK-based InsurTech, a rise of almost 2 percentage points (ppts) the past two decades has been realized. But it is also a genuine on 2023. This was the largest gain among all countries. reflection of how much excitement there is in the industry. 1One notable deal was excluded from the funding data this quarter; Bolttechs USD100 million Series C round. Bolttech was acquired from Amtrust by Pacific Century in 2019. We exclude equity funding rounds to companies that have already exited. 67 Introduction Yet AIs current value, if were honest, has been limited. It has During that process, much of the chaff was separated from the not revolutionized role types, freed up peoples time or delivered wheat and individual InsurTech companies learned (or failed) that on the kinds of efficiency gains that we might have expected, but they had to focus on their core goals and products, learning it is we must give it time. profitability, not growth, that is vital to long-term survival. Perhaps it is no coincidence, but as mega-round funding deals have reduced Much like InsurTech more broadly, AI must be part of a use case and fewer unicorns (billion-dollar startups) have been created, that is commercially sound and supports a broader set of business there has also been a conspicuous lack of over-hiring and rushed objectives. Using AI to assist underwriters to make better risk business decisions. In short, the sector has matured, and the selection decisions is one such clear use case, for example.

The UK has maintained its position as 119 InsurTech deals in 2024. These companies commanded the nation with the second-largest share of global InsurTech deals higher average deal sizes of USD18.93 million, compared to since 2017. Other nations with the largest deal share increases USD12.21 million for non-AI-centered InsurTechs. Half of the between 2023 and 2024 are: top 10 companies by funding round were AI-centered.  Canada: 1.78ppt increase to 3.20%  Germany: 1.78ppt increase to 3.20%  South Korea: 1.21ppt increase to 1.45%  Switzerland: 0.79ppt increase to 1.74% Meanwhile, South Africa experienced the largest decrease among AI-centered InsurTechs raised USD370.76 million in funding all countries in global InsurTech deal share  falling 1.42ppts, from across 33 Q4 deals. 6 of the top 10 companies by funding round 1.24% in 2023 to zero in 2024. were AI-centered, and 19 of the 33 AI-centered InsurTech deals involved early-stage companies. Other nations with the largest deal share decreases within InsurTech between 2023 and 2024 are:  Australia: -1.37ppts, from 1.66% to 0.29%  Nigeria: -1.18ppts, from 1.18% to zero  Sweden: -1.18ppts, from 1.18% to zero  United Arab Emirates: -0.71%, from 0.71% to zero. Pertinent to the theme of this particular report, 39 of the 78 Q4\\'24 The United States continued to lead in global InsurTech deal share, InsurTech deals involved claims-focused InsurTechs. Notably, seeing 50.58% of all InsurTech deals in 2024. these companies raised a majority (57.2%) of total funding. 5 of the top 10 companies by funding round were included in this category.Introduction Many of the 39 InsurTechs focus on multiple aspects of the claims Venture technology investments by insurance companies process. 16 companies are either insurers or intermediaries, with 10 increased by 10 QoQ, from 35 in Q3 2024 to 45 in Q4 2024. 25 placing the most emphasis on first notice of loss (FNOL). of the 45 investments went to United States-based companies.

Some of these are cutting-edge AI applications; others are more in the nature of AI enhancements to existing, well-known technologies.

Gartner predicts 85% of customer interactions will be chatbot- managed by 2030. AI and RPA can improve claim triaging, especially for larger insurers, by automating processes and enhancing accuracy. Chatbots can mimic human claim handlers, quickly assessing customer needs and streamlining triage. Integrated within an insurers app, chatbots can pull data via APIs, eliminating low-value questions and speeding up the process. AI captures claim details, corrects errors, and guides customers through the process while detecting potential fraud. With AI, chatbots also learn to predict customer queries and reduce subjectivity in handling claims. 19Introduction Claim process Function Stimulus Tech functionality Benefits Engagement/ Direct reporting Live connection, image With the right technology, a policyholder can simply Investigation/ recognition through take a photo or a video of an incident that then Fraud review videography and photography leads to an expedient decision about an event (and supported by image subsequent release of capital)  another win-win for recognition/direct to platform, both parties. and historical cataloging. As expectations change, modern-day consumers expect to be able to file a claim on mobile technology in the same way that they conduct other parts of their lives.

Blending technology and domain expertise advancement in technology is enabling claim functions to evolve rapidly and deliver greater efficiency and improved customer experience, while also increasing claim cost control through more effective deployment of resources and sophisticated targeting of cases requiring investigation. In our view, those embarking on this journey achieve the best outcomes when they blend technology and business domain expertise to design their end-to-end solution and integrate insurance analytical software effectively. This approach of combining decision engine technology with advanced analytics, including machine learning, is already being used in other areas of the insurance value chain, like underwriting and pricing, to optimize performance and deliver competitive advantage. 21IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn Claim process Function Stimulus Tech functionality Benefits Settlement Fraud detection NLP/date lags/IP changes AI fraud detection is a machine learning-based (predictive analytics on algorithm and accompanying decision-support claim likelihood/ adjustment system that automatically detects fraud and helps likelihood)  through pattern fraud investigators segment, prioritize and investigate recognition Dashcam claims more efficiently. text mining, rules and These flag suspicious cases for claim handlers/ database searches. adjusters; it is estimated in the UK that 50% all of claims have an element of fraud, adding significantly to premiums. Dashcam footage can provide video evidence that proves fault and helps to explain any surrounding circumstances to an insurer. This type of technology can also detect insurance fraud before the claims are paid, which reduces loss ratio and limits false positives. Combined, these features enhance customer experience and enable fast track claims. These tools are primarily there to assist and alert but not to make concrete decisions. Automated preload RPA, smart contracts. This applies a set of rules that determine threshold automatic payment conditions in different scenarios  perhaps related to country of origin, business unit and other macro variables. It calculates the score and application of the appropriate workflow: auto payment, normal payment, more information required or investigate. Parametric tools Parametric insurance is made possible by insurers adoption of always-on digital systems, together with developments in forecasting and weather monitoring technology. With the emergence of parametric products, customers living in at-risk areas can insure themselves for fixed amounts against very specific weather or seismic activity. Premiums can be calculated against real-world data and sophisticated meteorological modeling. Payments can be triggered automatically when local monitoring stations report particular events (e.g., a certain amount of rainfall, wind speed or earthquakes of specific magnitude). As extreme natural events become more common in certain areas, this kind of insurance removes the need for lengthy and expensive investigation while offering protection plans highly tailored to customer needs. 22One word of caution on this framework; it is tempting when If they are not available, a negative feedback loop will be evaluating where to implement a new technology solution to only implemented creating an extremely disgruntled and, likely, look at the ROI  however in some cases this misses the point of emotionally stressed client. the technology.

About a decade later, companies were in fact quite early adopters of data science and ACORD implemented the first electronic data interchange (EDI) operations, thanks to their need for structured and unstructured protocols for the insurance industry, enabling more seamless data data to adjudicate claims. transfers and automations between systems. Over 50 years ago, the data-heavy areas of coverage verifications, Now, as we enter a new tech era, once again insurers are making claims history, and customer data were prime targets for more a leap to incorporate new technology; large language models efficient processing.

The industry association ACORD (Association for in accurately determining the claims indemnity, while also Cooperative Operations Research and Development) was set up minimizing loss adjusting expenses  creating a win-win for both 65Thought Leadership insurers and the insured. This is done primarily in five ways: Predictive analytics 1. Intelligent data extraction and summarization One of the most exciting areas for GenAIs application to claims is 2.

The data-rich environment of the claims function is ripe for content ingestion, analysis and summarization through GenAI. Scenario analysis is also helping adjusters understand the One relevant example is the speedy analysis of documentation, likelihood of a claim increasing in severity by incorporating inputs such as police reports and repair estimates in personal lines, or from varied data sources to show potential escalation paths as architectural drawings and forensic expert reports in commercial evidenced by tools such as EvolutionIQ for workers compensation lines.

As litigation inflation continues to impact relevant information to the appropriate person to handle the next carriers liability books, scenario analysis is also being used to step in the claims process. simulate different settlement outcomes, helping adjusters make informed decisions during negotiations. GenAI can also analyze images and documents to identify potential flags such as time limits or demands that must be met Indemnity accuracy to avoid escalation. In lines of business like Auto and Workers There are several key factors that go into determining indemnity.

This can be the indemnification process, which is demonstrated by InsurTechs complicated by endorsements and jurisdiction-specific case law, such as Photocert. but GenAI greatly helps to focus on efforts for complex claims. GenAI is also aiding claims by identifying missing information and The second area that greatly impacts indemnity is fraud. One of duplicates, so that the adjuster can focus efforts on completed the most common applications for GenAI in claims today is fraud claim files.
