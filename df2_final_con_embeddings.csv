to build buy or rent their new technology solutions FREDDIE SCARRATT Global Deputy Head of Gallagher Re InsurTech Build buy or rent How to pick your strategy for InsurTech implementation If the internet kicked off the first age of digital transformation Building technology inhouse then the insurance industry is currently undergoing its second A strategic advantage This time it is driven by technological advancements in data Building technology inhouse can be a good strategic decision analytics automation machine learning and large language The ability to tailor the technology to meet the specific needs of a models These technologies present compelling opportunities reinsurers operations is a significant benefit Whether for claims for reinsurers to enhance operational efficiency and customer automation risk assessment or customer engagement a custom experiences and drive growth from underwriting performance built platform can align perfectly with the insurers business model throughout the insurance market cycle Creating proprietary technology offers an opportunity for However to gain the benefits reinsurers first need to make a reinsurers to differentiate themselves creating distinctive value critical decision should they build buy or rent their technology propositions that set them apart from competitors For example solutions The proliferation of InsurTech

pricing added a new dimension to this question models and faster policy issuance This then becomes a competitive advantage one that is only strengthened in noncommoditized classes of businesses Page  InsurTech Team Corner Building inhouse technology gives reinsurers full ownership Nevertheless there are challenges and the obvious one is cost of their intellectual property IP allowing them control

reinsurers looking for scalable flexible solutions without the reinsurers looking to create a competitive advantage It should burden of managing onpremises infrastructure therefore be deployed in areas which make a real difference to underwriting Buying technology from InsurTech vendors offers One of the primary advantages of renting technology is its quick deployment and access to proven solutions but may lack the costeffectiveness Cloudbased solutions have lower upfront costs customization required to meet specific business needs Renting than building or buying technology outright The subscription technology through cloud platforms provides flexibility and model also allows reinsurers to scale their usage as needed scalability at a lower cost but reinsurers must balance this

the speedy analysis of documentation likelihood of a claim increasing in severity by incorporating inputs such as police reports and repair estimates in personal lines or from varied data sources to show potential escalation paths as architectural drawings and forensic expert reports in commercial evidenced by tools such as EvolutionIQ for workers compensation lines This can also incorporate

determining indemnity Compensation for example overlaying documents with telematics Firstly coverage verification  establishing exactly what the data can help adjusters better understand the loss and speed up insured is responsible for and during what time frame This can be the indemnification process which is demonstrated by InsurTechs complicated by endorsements and jurisdictionspecific case law such as Photocert but GenAI greatly helps to focus on efforts for complex claims GenAI is also aiding claims by identifying missing information and The second area that greatly impacts indemnity is fraud One of duplicates so that the adjuster can focus efforts on completed the most common applications for GenAI in claims today is fraud claim files For personal lines this could be further automated to detection because the same capabilities that support document establish lowtouch or notouch workflows through solutions such analysis and summarization also can be used to identify anomalies as COMPEX in a claim file or suspicious trends over several claims files Companies such as FRISS and Shift Technology are leaders across different lines of business in actively detecting fraudulent claims patterns Page  Thought Leadership Reduction of loss adjusting expenses quickly reach consistent indemnity decisions GenAI is also being used to both identify training needs and

yet encouraging H followed by a more volatile H The number of InsurTech deals increased by  QoQ from  to with an initial surge in megaround activity followed by a sharp  in Q  decrease in funding in Q Interest in AI companies remained strong with AIfocused We began  with the observation that  had been the InsurTechs accounting for  of Q  deals With the topic year that AI was first widely taken seriously in our industry of this quarters InsurTech report in mind half of Q InsurTech This year has continued the trajectory of acceptance with pilots deals went to InsurTechs with a focus on claims Q  also saw proofs of concept use cases technological development and  venture technology investments from reinsurance companies most importantly a further beddingin of AI being used in real life scenarios We observed that on average AIenabled InsurTechs Looking at yearonyear YoY comparisons between  and raised an additional  million when compared with their nonAI  total global InsurTech funding dropped  YoY from cousins In Q  of InsurTechs that raised new money were USD billion in  to USD billion in   the lowest AIfocused amount since  Global InsurTech deal count fell  YoY from  in  to  in   the lowest since  Early It is also true that AI is a buzzword Like many other labels before stage funding and average deal sizes increased YoY   and it it is in vogue as a marketing term and even as a toplevel  respectively AIcentered InsurTechs accounted for  domain in URLs as in wwwcompanynameai In some quarters of deals during the calendar year From a geographical standpoint there is a lack of clarity and discipline around how the term is the UK cemented its position as the worlds secondmost used It is easy to dismiss some of this as hype or to point out significant market for InsurTech in   of deals involved a that not all the value technology providers have promised over UKbased InsurTech a rise of almost  percentage points ppts the past two decades has been realized But it is also a genuine on  This was the largest gain among all countries reflection of how much excitement there is in the industry One notable deal was excluded from the funding data this quarter Bolttechs USD million Series C round Bolttech was acquired from Amtrust by Pacific Century in  We exclude equity funding rounds to companies that have already exited Page  Introduction Yet AIs current value if were honest has been limited It has During that process much of the chaff was separated from the not revolutionized role types freed up peoples time or delivered wheat and individual InsurTech companies learned or failed that on the kinds of efficiency gains that we might have expected but they had to focus on their core goals and products learning it is we must give it time profitability not growth that is vital to longterm survival Perhaps it is no coincidence but as megaround funding deals have reduced Much like InsurTech more broadly AI must be part of a use case and fewer unicorns billiondollar startups have been created that is commercially sound and supports a broader set of business there has also been a conspicuous lack of overhiring and rushed objectives Using AI to assist underwriters to make better risk business decisions In short the sector has matured and the selection decisions is one such clear use case for example Using AI industry is much better for it to send customers down company rabbit holes where call centers once existed is not If InsurTech taught us anything it is that just  also saw strong continuing interest in InsurTech from insurer because you can do something does not mean you should and reinsurer CVCs Picking a month at random October saw almost USD million invested by industry CVC funds Notable We think that  has
